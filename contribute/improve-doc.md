# Improve documentation

## Any user can change the online doc

This site is hosted on the GitBook platform, **which lets users update the documentation**, like in a Wiki. Making changes is super easy because it's done directly in the internet browser, nothing to install.

If you want to make some changes just send me an email \([here](https://www.jjazzlab.com/en/contact/)\) I'll reply with a link to grant you write access rights to the JJazzLab GitBook. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're a GitHub user you can also use the **Edit on GitHub** button in the upper right of each page, or make a pull-request directly on the [JJazzLab-X-UserGuide repository](https://github.com/jjazzboss/JJazzLab-X-UserGuide).
{% endhint %}

## Translate the online doc

You can also help by fixing or adding new translations. Currently there is English and Japanese. If you language does not exist yet, contact me \([here](https://www.jjazzlab.com/en/contact/)\) so that I add a "GitBook variant" for that language.
