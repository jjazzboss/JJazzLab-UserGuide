# Improve documentation

This site is hosted on the GitBook platform, which lets users update the documentation, like in a Wiki. Making changes is rather easy because it's done directly in the internet browser with a simple editor.

If you want to make some changes just send me an email \([here](https://www.jjazzlab.com/en/contact/)\) and tell me briefly what you want to do so I can grant you write access rights to the JJazzLab GitBook. 

If you're a GitHub user you can also use the **Edit on GitHub** button in the upper right of each page, or make a pull-request directly on the [JJazzLabXUserGuide repository](https://github.com/jjazzboss/JJazzLabXUserGuide).
