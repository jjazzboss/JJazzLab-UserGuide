## It's easy

JJazzLab uses the [crowdin.com](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MQE7B7yjVY3xzlsorS4-887967055/contribute/crowdin.com) platform, which makes it super easy to translate phrases, directly from your browser.

## Who can do it?

Everyone, provided that you're a native speaker of the target language and you're familiar with music software terms.

## How to start?

* [**https://crwd.in/jjazzlab**](https://crwd.in/jjazzlab)  and register (it's free)
* Choose a target language
* Select a translation file (phrases are grouped per feature or UI component)
* Pick an English phrase and translate it

Use **ctrl-O** (or **upper-left menu Open**) to open a different file. Done!

Crowdin provides many other translation facilities, like automatic translation proposals, possibility to request more info, a validation process, etc.

## Recommendations & tips

* **The shorter the better**\
  Don't forget that your phrases will be part of the JJazzLab user interface. &#x20;
* **Be consistent across translations**\
  If "leadsheet" is "xyz" in your language, try to reuse "xyz" whenever possible. Use the Glossary if a term is often reused.
* **Translate the Glossary first**\
  It's the last translation file at the bottom. It contains the most used terms found in JJazzLab, and helps maintain consistency across translations.
* **Proofreader role**\
  A proofreader validates maintains consistency and validate translation phrases. If you feel ready for this role, feel free to [contact me](https://www.jjazzlab.com/en/contact/).
* **Language missing?**\
  If you want to add a language not listed in Crowdin, feel free to [contact me](https://www.jjazzlab.com/en/contact/).
* **Want to try JJazzLab with the latest translation files?**\
