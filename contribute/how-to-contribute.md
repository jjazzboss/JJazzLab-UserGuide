# Improve documentation

This site is hosted by GitBook, which lets users update the documentation, like in a Wiki. Making changes is rather easy because it's done directly in the internet browser via a WYSIWIG editor.

If you want to contribute just send me an email \([here](https://www.jjazzlab.com/en/contact/)\) and tell me briefly what you want to do so I can grant you write access rights to the JJazzLab GitBook. 

If you're a GitHub user you can also use the **Edit on GitHub** button in the upper right of each page, or make a pull-request directly on the [JJazzLabDoc repository](https://github.com/jjazzboss/JJazzLabDoc).
