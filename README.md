## What is JJazzLab ? 

![](.gitbook/assets/jjazzlabscreenshot-w500.png)

ðŸŽµ JJazzLab is a desktop application which automatically generates backing tracks for any song, even complex ones. Itâ€™s a jam buddy to have fun improvising at home, learn new stuff or just practice your instrument. Itâ€™s also a great tool for teachers.  

ðŸŽ· JJazzLab is designed to make non-boring backing tracks, backing tracks with variety, rhythmic accents and dynamics. You can start a solo slowly and gradually build up the atmosphere! 

ðŸ’» Thanks to the JJazzLab-X open-source platform,  JJazzLab can easily be extended to add new features and new music generation capabilities.   

## Getting started

### Video tutorials

First, watch this short [YouTube video "How to make a backing track in 60 sec."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkOm8l5Xb1g), it shows the main concepts in less than 2 minutes. 

For a more complete video tutorial \(but longer, 15 min.\), it's here: [YouTube JazzLab tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEP02JZexEU).

JJazzLab is a Midi application. It does not produce sounds itself, rather it sends Midi messages \(e.g. "play 

JJazzLab needs to know about your Midi configuration in order to work properly.
