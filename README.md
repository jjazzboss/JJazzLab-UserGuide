## Where to start?

Try this very short [video tutorial](video-tutorials.md#for-starters).

## What is JJazzLab?

ðŸŽµ JJazzLab is a desktop application which automatically generates backing tracks for any song, even complex ones. Itâ€™s a jam buddy to have fun improvising at home, learn new stuff or just practice your instrument. Itâ€™s also a great tool for teachers.

ðŸŽ· JJazzLab is designed to make non-boring backing tracks, backing tracks with variety, rhythmic accents and dynamics. You can start a solo slowly and gradually build up the atmosphere!

ðŸ’» JJazzLab is open-source:  developers can easily add new features and new music generation capabilities.
