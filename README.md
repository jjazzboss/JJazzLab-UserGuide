## What is JJazzLab?

🎵 With JJazzLab you quickly create backing tracks for any song, even complex ones. It’s a jam buddy to have fun practicing at home or learn new stuff. It’s also a great tool for teaching or early-stage composing.

🎷 JJazzLab is designed to make non-boring backing tracks, backing tracks with variety, rhythmic accents and dynamics. You can start a solo slowly and gradually build up the atmosphere!

💻 JJazzLab is open-source with an open architecture:  developers can easily add new features and new music generation capabilities.

## Getting started

[Install ](installation.md)and run JJazzLab, then :

1. Load an example song file : **menu File/Open Songs...** and select **ExampleFiles/BluesMinor.sng**
2. Press the **Play** button : you should hear the backing track -if not, check the Midi Out device in **menu Tools/Options (Preferences on Mac)**
3. Start editing the song using the [**editors** ](/broken/pages/YEW9jmd1iUG7OEU4PzlR)and hear how it impacts the generated backing track.
