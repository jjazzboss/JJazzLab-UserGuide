## What is JJazzLab?

ðŸŽµ With JJazzLab you quickly create backing tracks for any song, even complex ones. Itâ€™s a jam buddy to have fun practicing at home or learn new stuff. Itâ€™s also a great tool for teaching or early-stage composing.

ðŸŽ· JJazzLab is designed to make non-boring backing tracks, backing tracks with variety, rhythmic accents and dynamics. You can start a solo slowly and gradually build up the atmosphere!

ðŸ’» JJazzLab is open-source with an open architecture:  developers can easily add new features and new music generation capabilities.

## Getting started

[Install ](installation.md)and run JJazzLab, then :

1. Load an example song file : **menu File/Open Songs...** and select **ExampleFiles/BluesMinor.sng**
2. Press the **Play** button : you should hear the backing track -if not, check the Midi Out device in **menu Tools/Options (Preferences on Mac)**
3. Start editing the song using the [**editors** ](broken-reference)and hear how it impacts the generated backing track.

If you prefer to quickly create a new backing track from scratch, check out this video:
