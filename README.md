## What is JJazzLab? 

![](.gitbook/assets/jjazzlabscreenshot-w500.png)

ðŸŽµ JJazzLab is a desktop application which automatically generates backing tracks for any song, even complex ones. Itâ€™s a jam buddy to have fun improvising at home, learn new stuff or just practice your instrument. Itâ€™s also a great tool for teachers.  

ðŸŽ· JJazzLab is designed to make non-boring backing tracks, backing tracks with variety, rhythmic accents and dynamics. You can start a solo slowly and gradually build up the atmosphere! 

ðŸ’» Thanks to the JJazzLab-X open-source platform,  JJazzLab can easily be extended to add new features and new music generation capabilities.
