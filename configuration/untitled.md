VirtualMIDISynth is a free, lightweight \(~2MB!\) and efficient SoundFont player for Windows. It is implemented as a Windows multimedia user driver, so it is directly accessible as a standard MIDI Out device.

Note that VirtualMIDISynth can also convert Midi files to .mp3. This way you can easily get a JJazzLab backing track as an audio file. See the FAQ for more info.

Instructions

Download JJazzLab-SoundFont.sf2 from the Musical Artefacts web site



Download and install VirtualMIDISynth from the CoolSoft web site \(accept all installer default settings\)



Load the Soundfont in VirtualMIDISynth

  

Click on the pen icon if you need to adjust the default volume \(0-500%\) of the SoundFont.



Start JJazzLab and go to Midi Options/Preferences, set VirtualMIDISynth as the Midi Out device

  



Go to the Output Synth Editor and apply the preset VirtualMIDISynth

 

The Midi Configuration Wizard will automatically perform steps 4 \(if VirtualMIDISynth is installed\) and 5 if you choose to use the JJazzLab SoundFon
