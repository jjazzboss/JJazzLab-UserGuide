# JJazzLab SoundFont

The **JJazzLab SoundFont** is optimized for JJazzLab with a good trade-off between **sound quality** and **ease of set up**.

This free SoundFont contains 128 high-quality GM sounds plus some extra sounds. It also contains 14 XG-compatible drum kits.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Most Yamaha styles use the XG drum map, which defines more drum sounds than the GM drum map. If your [output synth](../output-synth.md) is not XG-compatible JJazzLab will make its best to make the style drums/percussion sound OK, but it may be not optimal.
