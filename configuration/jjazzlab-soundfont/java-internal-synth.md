# Java internal synth

The Java runtime engine used by JJazzLab has an internal Midi synth (sometimes callled Gervill).

If you don't load a SoundFont file it will use its built-in GM sounds.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The built-in GM sounds are not good quality sounds, but it can be enough to test JJazzLab. The good thing is that no setup is required, it will work out-of-the-box.

## Initial setup with the JJazzLab SoundFont <a href="setup-instructions" id="setup-instructions"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Java internal synth is not high-performance. When used with a large SoundFont like the JJazzLab SoundFont you may hear some dropped notes when too many notes are played.&#x20;

If youâ€™re on Mac OSX the [Midi configuration wizard](../midi-configuration.md#midi-configuration-wizard) will automatically perform the same steps if you choose to use the JJazzLab SoundFont.
