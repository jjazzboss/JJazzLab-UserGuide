In the song structure editor you select the rhythm which will be used to generate the backing track.

Each song part can have its own rhythm. In practice however it’s difficult to have more than 2 or 3 different rhythms in one song because you’ll reach the 16 Midi channel limit.

Each rhythm defines _rhythm parameters_ which let you adjust the way music is generated. _Rhythm parameters_ can be adjusted on each song part.
