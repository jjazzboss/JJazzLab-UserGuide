## An open-source framework <a id="an-open-source-framework"></a>

  
 The foundation of JJazzLab is released as an open-source framework: JJazzLab-X. Itâ€™s a platform dedicated to backing tracks generation which helps developers create new music generation engines.

Visit the [JJazzLab-X GitHub website](https://github.com/jjazzboss/JJazzLab-X) for more info.

JJazzLab is built upon JJazzLab-X and currently adds a _music generation engine_ called YamJJazz.
