# JJazzLab

JJazzLab embeds the **YamJJazz** rhythm generation engine. This engine reads [Yamaha style files](https://www.jjazzlab.com/en/doc/yamaha-style-files) and introduces a new [Yamaha extended style](https://www.jjazzlab.com/en/doc/yamjjazz-extended-style-files) file format which adds more variations to existing Yamaha style files.

You can see below the 2 YamJJazz rhythm providers available in the rhythm selection dialog.  
   
 The _YamJJazz standard styles_ rhythm provider reads standard Yamaha files such as .sty, .prs, .sst or .bcs.

The _YamJJazz standard styles_ rhythm provider reads “YamJJazz Extended” Yamaha files with the .yjz extension \(the corresponding standard Yamaha file must be present too\).
