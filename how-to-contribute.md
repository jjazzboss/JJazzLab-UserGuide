# How to contribute

The document is hosted by GitBook, which lets users update the documentation, like in a Wiki. Edition is done directly in the internet browser, it's quite easy and you don't need to be a computer guru.

If you want to help just send me an email \([here](https://www.jjazzlab.com/en/contact/)\)  and tell me briefly what you want to do, so I can grant you write access rights to the JJazzLab GitBook. 

Note that if you're a GitHub user you can also make a pull-request directly on the JJazzLabDoc repository.
