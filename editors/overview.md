### Use the [**Song Structure Editor**](song-structure.md) to:

* Define the order of sections using [song parts](song-structure.md#song-parts) , eg "AABA", "verse verse chorus verse", ...
* Edit the song part [rhythm](song-structure.md#change-rhythm) and [rhythm parameters](song-structure.md#rhythm-parameters) to introduce dynamics and variations
