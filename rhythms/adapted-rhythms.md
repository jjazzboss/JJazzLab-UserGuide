# Adapted rhythms

If you change the time signature of a **section**, JJazzLab will use an **adapted rhythm** for the impacted **song parts**. This is simply the same rhythm but shortened or repeated to fit the new measure size.

You’ll notice that the **adapted rhythm** does not need additional channels in the mix console: it uses the Midi channels of its source rhythm (**fastbossa.s629.prs** in the example above).

If you don’t want the **adapted rhythm**, juste replace it using the **rhythm selection dialog**.
