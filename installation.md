{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

If you get a **Windows Smart Screen** alert

Windows Smart Screen blocks the program NOT because it is a malware \(it is NOT!\), but just because JJazzLab is new, so Windows security servers don't have enough statistics to evaluate its "security reputation".

Once enough users will have successfully downloaded and installed it, Windows Smart Screen will not block the program anymore.

You can find more explanations in this [good article](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/what-smartscreen-filter-how-does-it-work).
