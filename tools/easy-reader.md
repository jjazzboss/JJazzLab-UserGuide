# Easy Reader

The Easy Reader (**menu Tools/Easy Reader**) always shows the 2 currently playing bars.&#x20;

It's make it easy to follow the playing chords and lyrics, even for of a complex song with many song parts.

When a bar annotation uses the [special **#** syntax](../editors/chord-lead-sheet.md#special-syntax-for-easy-reader), only the relevant part of the annotation is shown.

Like most of the JJazzLab windows, you can undock the Easy Reader to place it wherever you want:
