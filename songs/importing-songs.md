# Importing songs

## Band In A Box song files

JJazzLab can import _.SG\*_ or _.MG\*_ song files.

Only the following Band-In-A-Box data are used to generate the corresponding JJazzLab song :

* **song structure**: chorus start, chorus end, number of chorus, tag after, tag start, tag end, 2 bar ending
* **chord symbols**: name, position \(including optional push settings\), rest/hold/shot settings
* **song settings**: allow push/rest in first/middle/last chorus.

The song import feature is not 100% reliable, but most of the files should be OK.

### Time signature limitation

By default the imported song will be in 4‚ÅÑ4: for most files time signature changes are ignored.

## musicXML files

JJazzLab can import musicXML \(.xml\) or compress musicXML \(.mxl\). The import is limited to the main elements only \(chord symbols, etc.\).

## Impro-Visor leadsheet files

JJazzLab can import Impro-Visor \(.ls\) leadsheet files. The import is limited to the main elements only \(chord symbols, etc.\).
