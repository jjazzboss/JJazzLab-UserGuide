# Importing songs

## Band In A Box song files

JJazzLab can import .SG\* or .MG\* song files.

Only the following Band-In-A-Box data are used to generate the corresponding JJazzLab song :

* **song structure**: chorus start, chorus end, number of chorus, tag after, tag start, tag end, 2 bar ending
* **chord symbols**: name, position \(including optional push settings\), rest/hold/shot settings
* **song settings**: allow push/rest in first/middle/last chorus.

The song import feature is not 100% reliable, but most of the files should be OK.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**By default imported songs will be in 4/4**. If you know that the imported song is in 3/4, then when import is done just select the initial time signature and use righ-click menu **Set time signature** to fix the time signature.
{% endhint %}

## musicXML files

JJazzLab can import musicXML \(.xml\) or compress musicXML \(.mxl\). 

The import is limited to the time signatures and chord symbols.

## Impro-Visor leadsheet files

JJazzLab can import Impro-Visor \(.ls\) leadsheet files. 

The import is limited to the time signatures and chord symbols.
