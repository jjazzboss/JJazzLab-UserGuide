# Using FluidSynth

It's a **ready-to-use** synth **optimally configured** for JJazzLab. FluidSynth should be enabled by default when you first launch JJazzLab.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If FluidSynth appears disabled, it means that a problem occured while trying to load FluidSynth. Check the [installation instructions](../installation.md).
{% endhint %}
